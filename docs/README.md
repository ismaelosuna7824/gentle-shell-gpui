# Documentation

Gentle Shell GPUI is a desktop app in Rust ([GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs) + gpui-kit) that gives [Gentle Shell](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-shell)'s agents a native interface: each agent tab launches `gentle-shell --mode rpc` and talks to it over JSONL. This folder explains how it is built, how it integrates and how to work on it.

| Talk to Gentle Shell, read or write its configuration, or add an outside service | [`integrations.md`](integrations.md) |
| Build, test without touching your real app, open a PR or publish a release | [`development.md`](development.md) |

## Current decisions

| ADR | In one line |
| --- | --- |
| [0001](adr/0001-modular-monolith.md) | One binary organized by feature, with explicit boundaries. |
| [0002](adr/0002-incremental-pure-core.md) | Pure logic lives in `gentle-core` and grows one complete behavior at a time. |
| [0003](adr/0003-behavior-preserving-refactors.md) | Refactors don't change behavior; fixes go in separate commits. |
| [0004](adr/0004-native-mermaid-rendering.md) | Mermaid diagrams are drawn with merman's CLI, downloaded only when someone asks for it. |

For an AI agent or someone new, the short entry point is [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
